          <h2>PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Narendra Damodardas Modi is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current
                 prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief
                  minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of 
                  Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
                   (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu
                    nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest 
                 prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.
                Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]

          <ul>
            <li>
                Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor
                 public image following the earthquake in Bhuj.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has 
                been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed,
                 three-quarters of whom were Muslim
                or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis.
            </li>
            <li>
                A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India
                 found no evidence 
                to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party 
                a majority in the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, 
                the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration
                 has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and 
                 reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modi centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, 
                Modi has received consistently high approval ratings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India,
                 though few details of where he went have emerged.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.
                Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.
            </li>
            <li>
                In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: 
                the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna 
                Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.
               Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away,
                 after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and 
                 Guwahati. Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected,
                  before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968â€“69. Sometime in late 1969
                   or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedab.
                 There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road 
                 Transport Corporation.
